## 🚀 Project Overview  

In today’s high-speed digital economy, **fraudulent transactions** can slip through the cracks faster than traditional systems can catch them. **Fraud Buster** is designed to be a **reliable guardian** — detecting fraudulent activities with **machine learning**, **balancing imbalanced datasets with SMOTE**, and **shedding light on model decisions using explainable AI techniques**.  

**Why this matters:**  
- ⚡ **Fast & Accurate** fraud detection for real-time risk mitigation.  
- 🛡 **Balanced Learning** with SMOTE to handle rare fraud cases.  
- 🔍 **Explainable ML** for transparent decision-making.
